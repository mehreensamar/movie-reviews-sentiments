This project focuses on analyzing movie reviews to determine the sentiment behind them‚Äîwhether the review is positive or negative. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to classify the emotional tone of textual data.
üé¨ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning
Understanding how audiences feel about a movie is crucial for filmmakers, studios, and review platforms. This project aims to automate the process of determining whether a movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

By training on a labeled dataset of movie reviews, the system learns to detect emotional tone and opinion, helping users quickly analyze large volumes of feedback. It can be used to summarize viewer satisfaction, filter harmful reviews, or guide content recommendations.

üß† Project Objective
The objective of this project is to:

Classify movie reviews based on sentiment (positive or negative).

Build a robust sentiment analysis model using NLP techniques.

Provide a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

üìÅ Dataset Used
The project uses a public dataset such as IMDb Movie Reviews, which contains thousands of reviews labeled with:
